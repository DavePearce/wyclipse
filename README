Introduction
======================================================================

Whiley is a programming language particularly suited to
safety-critical systems. It is a hybrid object-oriented and functional
programming language which employs extended static checking to
eliminate errors at compile time, including divide-by-zero, array
out-of-bounds and null dereference errors.  Whiley compiles to the
Java Virtual Machine and is fully inter-operable with existing Java
applications.
